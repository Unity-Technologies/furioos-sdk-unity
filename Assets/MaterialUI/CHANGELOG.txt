- As ripples now use a custom material, using other custom materials now won't work.
- Due to the tweening system (introduced in v1.1.0) working in a different way, EasyTween is still no longer be able to tween values. This functionality will be replaced in v1.2.0.

-- IMPROVEMENTS --
- [Buttons] Massive performance improvements in both the editor and (especially) at runtime!

- [Components] Almost every component now has a interactable boolean, similar to that on standard uGUI components. (interactable can still be toggled manually on uGUI components for custom 'disabled' behaviour).
- [DialogAnimator] Added ability to choose slide in/out direction and tween type (you can see an example of how to use that in the Dialog example scene).
- [Divider] Added ability to create vertical dividers.
- [Icons] Update MaterialDesign icon set (41 new icons).
- [InputField] Improved the use of customTextValidator, we now just need to call IsTextValid() instead of ValidateText(text, validationText).
- [InputField] Added option to only validate text upon first selection of InputField, rather than on Start.
- [Panel] Added more creation options (go to MaterialUI -> Panel to see them).
- [Performance] The sprites used by MaterialUI are now packed into a spritesheet for better use of space at runtime.

- [Tab] Renamed pageEnabled to interactable.
- [Tab] Lower disabled Tab opacity.
- [Tween] Massively improved the Tween engine, which is now way faster! But will break your script if you used the old one.
- [Tween] Completely rewrote the tweening engine which now uses a new tweening method and pools tweens, resulting in a system which is now orders of magnitude faster! It's also a bit easy to use and keep track of active tweens.

-- FIXES --

- [Dialog] Fixed the dialog example scene.
- [Divider] Now have a min width/height (depending on horizontal or vertical divider) of 1.
